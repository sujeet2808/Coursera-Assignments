        &Lang; The Three R's: Reduce, Reuse and Recycle &Rang;
    </h1>

                    The first R is reduce, means reduce the amount of materials and goods you consume which lead to waste hierarchy. Reducing means making a conscious effort to look at how much stuff we use and questioning whether or not we need to be using it. To determine your true needs and avoid impulse buys, try the three day rule: if you want to buy something non-essential, wait three days. If you're still thinking about it three days later, then you can buy it. More than likely, you will have forgotten about it. The logic behind it is simple to understand – if there is less waste then there is less to recycle or reuse.

                <p>
                    The second R is reuse, and this simply means to get another use out of something that you were going to throw out or recycle. You may have a box of things you keep that are broken or that you don’t have for that you hang on to in-case you find another use for them; or you may find bargains on old furniture or go trash picking and get things that you can refinish – in either case you are working towards reusing the item. Learning to reuse items, like you can use jars from grocery as flowerpot for your small plants, or repurpose them for use different from what they are intended for is essential in the waste hierarchy.

                    The final R is the one that we pay the most attention to in this day and age, and that’s recycle. Recycling is the act of turning waste into new things, but it can’t be done with everything. The final R is the one that we pay the most attention to in this day and age, and that’s recycle. Recycling is the act of turning waste into new things, but it can’t be done with everything. Use recycling bins and spread the word by telling everyone to stop littering. Sell recyclables to reward yourself and give back to your community and the environment by running clean-up campaigns like <strong>&quot;Say No To Plastics&quot;</strong>.
